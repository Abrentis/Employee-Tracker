# Online Employee Tracker

## Description

Companies are always expanding, adding new workers to their forces. For large-scale companies, it gets hard to keep track of how many employees they have employed. With this application, it is easy to track existing and new employees, with features that allow the user to view their company's different departments, managers, positions, etc. After completing this application, it has given me a sense of how professional employee databases may behave or function.
